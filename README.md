## Philosophy

1. Drop is flexible. While abstractions and interfaces can make the codebase more complicated, the flexibility is worth it.
2. Drop is secure. The nature of Drop means an instance can never be accessible without authentication. In line with #1, Drop also supports a huge variety of authentication mechanisms, from a username/password to SSO.
3. Drop is user-friendly. The interface is designed to be clean and simple to use, with complexity available to the users who want it.
