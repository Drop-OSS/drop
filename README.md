Drop is an open-source game distribution platform, similar to GameVault or Steam. It's designed to distribute and share DRM-free games quickly, all while being incredibly flexible, beautiful, and fast.

## Philosophy

1. Drop is flexible. While abstractions and interfaces can complicate the codebase, the flexibility is worth it.
2. Drop is secure. The nature of Drop means an instance can never be accessible without authentication. In line with #1, Drop also supports a huge variety of authentication mechanisms, from username/password to SSO.
3. Drop is user-friendly. The interface is designed to be clean and simple to use, with advanced features available to users who want them.

## Deployment
